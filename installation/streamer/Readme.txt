Welcome to the Installer for Rifidi Streamer - The premier RFID Simulation Tool.  

Tag Streamer is a load testing tool for edge servers. It allows the user to create multiple virtual readers, chain them together in some way, and add batches of tags to the readers based on patterns. Furthermore, because the readers can exist on different physical hosts, Tag Streamer can distribute its load among several machines. The Tag Streamer UI allows users to rapidly construct the necessary xml files for a test suite. In addition, it allows the user to easily run test suites. 

Rifidi Streamer uses Java Sun JDK 1.6 update 4 and above
