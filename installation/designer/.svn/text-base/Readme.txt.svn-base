Welcome to 'Rifidi Designer - Software Defined RFID'

**Rifidi Designer REQUIRES JDK 6 Update 4**

Rifidi is a complete development and training tool. The goal of Rifidi is to
be able to accurately mimic a real-world environment and all of
the hardware components in that environment. This means that you can
essentially control all the pieces like RFID Readers, push arms,
conveyors and other devices and program them just like you would in real
life but without the up-front space and money that it usually requires.

Please Click on Rifidi.exe to launch the application.

For more details on Rifidi please look at the User's Manual at:

It is highly recommended to read this prior to using the product 
as it walks you through all the features.

Rifidi is the proud accomplishment of a great open source community and
some very dedicated developers.  Please give your feedback and comments
on our sourceforge site:  http://sourceforge.net/projects/rifidi/
