Welcome to the Installer for Rifidi Emulator - The premier RFID Simulation Tool.  

Rifidi helps you to create virtual readers that behave like commercially available ones.  
Using the Rifidi Emulator you can configure properties and generate tag reads just like having a
reader sitting next to you.  You can use this as an early start to development and also for testing.

Rifidi Emulator uses Java Sun JDK 1.6 update 10 and above

Please Click on the Rifidi.exe to launch the application.

Please look take a look at http://wiki.rifidi.org/index.php/Emulator_User's_Guide for the User's Guide.  It is highly recommended to read this
prior to using the product as it walks you through all the features.

In addition, you can find a list of new features and a change log at http://wiki.rifidi.org/index.php/Emulator_1.5.2
